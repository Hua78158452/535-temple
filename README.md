# EC535-Project: Air Quality Monitoring System

## Overview

The Air Quality Monitoring System is an embedded system based on the BeagleBone platform, designed to monitor air quality in real-time. The system is capable of measuring various parameters, such as CO2, CO, VOC, temperature, and humidity levels, providing crucial information for maintaining a safe and healthy environment.

## Features

* Integration of multiple sensors:
    * CCS811 sensor for CO2 and VOC detection
    * SI7021 sensor for temperature and humidity measurement
    * Flying-fish MQ-7 sensor for CO level monitoring
* 4.3" LCD screen for data display
* Color-coded LED system for real-time air quality status indication:
    * Green: Safe environment
    * Yellow: Changing environment
    * Red: Dangerous CO levels
* Suitable for various environments, including residential, commercial, and industrial settings
